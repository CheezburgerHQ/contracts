## üçî Cheezburger Smart Contracts

This repository contains the core smart contracts and interfaces powering the Cheezburger ecosystem.

## Overview

Cheezburger provides a decentralized infrastructure for creating and managing tokens with built-in liquidity solutions. Key components include:

- **Cheezburger Factory** - Enables no-code deployment of ERC20 tokens paired with automated liquidity provisioning.
- **Liquidity-Less Tokens** - Allows launching new tokens without needing to provide initial liquidity. Liquidity is handled transparently on-chain.
- **Social Tokens** - Allows creating tokenized profiles for any social media identity in just 2 clicks.

All contracts are immutable, non-upgradeable and internally audited for security. Cheezburger establishes a permissionless, decentralized token launch platform with fair distribution and anti-rug protections.
